# 😊 Facial Emotion Recognition & Emoji Mapping System

This project is a **Facial Expression Recognition System** that detects human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning, and maps each detected emotion to a corresponding emoji. The system supports **image input**, **video input**, and **live camera feed**, and outputs both **emotion classification results** and **visual emoji representation**. Voice feedback is also integrated for accessibility and fun!

## 🚀 Features

- 🎭 Real-time facial emotion recognition using CNN / Pretrained Models (VGG16/ResNet50/EfficientNet).
- 📸 Accepts input from:
  - Uploaded images
  - Uploaded videos
  - Live webcam feed
- 🧠 Trained on datasets like **CK+** and **AffectNet** for high accuracy.
- 😄 Maps multiple emojis to each emotion randomly for variety.
- 🔊 Emotion-specific **audio feedback** (e.g., laughter for happy, sigh for sad).
- 📊 Detailed **EDA and performance visualization**.
- 📱 Deployed using **Streamlit** for a responsive UI.
